		SlopeTransitionTipMirrored
		SquareSlopedCornerBase

ModAPI:
- IMyEntityCapacitorComponent was added (used by railguns, get using: block.Components.GetAs<IMyEntityCapacitorComponent>() )
- MyCubeGrid got:
    GetOwnerLoginTimeSeconds(), GetOwnerLogoutTimeSeconds()
    JumpWithWheels(), SendAbortJump(), RequestJump()
    PlayParticleBroadcast(), StopSmoke(), IsSmokeParticleActive getter
    ContainerOpened(), CompetetiveContainerOpened() (these should probably not be touched)
    KillAllCharacters() got bool removePilot parameter
    bool CloseGrid field (which seems unused)
- My3DEntitySoundEmitter's PlaySound() got bool forcePlaySound parameter (which plays even if entity is not in scene, does nothing for non-entity emitter)
- MyGunBase got User getter
- MyAPIGateway.Multiplayer.ReplicateEntityForClient() was removed (it was also empty in previous major so it did nothing anyway)
- MyObjectBuilder_SessionSettings got EnableTeamScoreCounters (accessible via MyAPIGateway.Session.SessionSettings)
- MyFontDefinition got static SplitIntoSameHeightStrings()
- IMyEntity got StopPhysicsActivation get&set
- IMyConfigDedicated got ChatAntiSpamEnabled, SameMessageTimeout, SpamMessagesTime, SpamMessagesTimeout
- IMyCubeGrid got InvokeDepressurizeEffect() (synchronized)
- Lots of interfaces got comments/xmldoc on them, some useful and some redundant xD
